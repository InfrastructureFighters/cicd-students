# 🚀 GitLab CI/CD: Workflows & Artifacts Guide

## 📜 Overview

## 🔄 1. GitLab CI/CD Workflow

### 💡 What is a Workflow?
A **workflow** in GitLab CI/CD defines **when** and **under what conditions** jobs and pipelines run.

### 🛠 Key Features:
- ✅ **Conditional execution** (`rules` / `only` / `except`)
- 🔗 **Pipeline chaining** (triggering downstream pipelines)
- 🏗 **Stages & dependencies** (control execution order)
- ⏳ **Scheduled pipelines** (run at fixed times)

### 📂 Example:
```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
```

## 📦 2. GitLab CI/CD Artifacts

### 💡 What are Artifacts?
**Artifacts** are files or directories **generated by a job** that can be **downloaded** or **passed to other jobs**.

### 🛠 Key Features:
- 📥 **Download job results** from the GitLab UI
- 🔄 **Pass build outputs** between stages
- ⏱ **Retention policies** to control artifact lifetime
- 🔒 **Access control** for sensitive files

### 📂 Example:
```yaml
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - make build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build/output/
    expire_in: 1 week
```
